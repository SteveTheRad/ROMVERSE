- Branch: `linux/stage1-desktop-readiness`
- Review status: **APPROVED — CONTAINED COMPANION LINK RUNTIME VERIFIED**

### Decision

The stale instrumentation interaction is corrected without changing the application. The complete
API-35 Companion inventory now passes through the current visible safety-code confirmation, performs
the real ephemeral TLS exchange, observes fresh health state, and reconnects its encrypted remembered
session while retaining zero execution authority.

This closes the contained fixture milestone. It does not claim a physical-phone result or prove that
the two independently runnable ROMVERSE applications can yet pair directly without the fixture. The
next bounded task therefore moves to a real-product integration journey instead of another unit,
packaging, architecture, or broad-regression loop.

### Independent repository and runtime evidence

- The implementation commit changes only
  `companion/app/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/radforge/romverse/companion/MainActivityInstrumentedTest.kt`.
  No production Activity, navigation, transport, Desktop source, dependency, Gradle file, asset, or
  protected original-checkout file changed.
- The test explicitly opens Link, fills the existing endpoint/fingerprint/code fields, proves the old
  checkbox remains disabled and non-clickable, and confirms through the visible accessibility action
  `YES • CODE MATCHES`. It contains no reflection, private hook, preference mutation, or direct-state
  bypass.
- Product Assurance independently read the raw runner log: 12 success status codes, zero failure or
  assumption-skip status, and `OK (12 tests)`. Its SHA-256 is
  `4490e6b7199de0e36c477528823a3083cae4237caba24717bbe269fa2e1a9a45`.
- The fixture log independently shows the exact order `ready → approved → first-health-snapshot →
  complete`, reports `execution_authority: none` at admission and completion, and finishes at
  `OPTIMAL`. Its SHA-256 is
  `9ddcbda1f97f062772239f89cc92a36b9387b7ed21921b8d2701378a95f8072b`.
- Product Assurance independently inspected the captured confirmation frame. It visibly presents the
  exact certificate-derived code, affirmative and decline choices, and the statement that Link grants
  no flash, root, wipe, unlock, relock, or command authority.
- Product Assurance also inspected the captured Live Console and bounded sequence sheet. The UI is
  readable and the sequence shows the unpaired state while the confirmation is present, followed by
  the Link/Console journey. Transient paired/Device-DNA/Ascension pages are supported by passing
  runtime assertions and are not overstated as separately captured frames.
- Product Assurance independently rehashed both artifacts. The unchanged application APK remains
  `62bc530d5f077e3e34ad71002caa24303a584bf4661f56d2cc338c976bfb5a2b`; the corrected instrumentation
  APK is `5239d6d7efc4b4ce574cc3c9c84cc62783c8e22bfccee306921108711949df5c`.
  ZIP integrity passed; the instrumentation package targets SDK 35, uses the AndroidJUnitRunner, and
  has one Android Debug signer with a verified v2 signature.
- After the bounded run, ADB was empty and no emulator or Link listener remained. SELinux stayed
  enforcing; no package/environment, firewall, host-security, or physical-device change occurred.

### Guided friction and safety review

- One meaningful identity decision is retained; the retired direct-checkbox shortcut is unusable.
- Companion remains a structured, read-only mission view. Pairing and telemetry confer no Recovery or
  command authority.
- Guardian-only execution, exact-device evidence, consent separation, UNKNOWN-on-uncertainty, no
  blind retry, independent reassessment/verification, and permanent no-relock remain intact.
- The short-lived listener's LAN bind/discovery behavior is described honestly. This approval is for
  the previously authorized ephemeral, zero-authority emulator run, not a network-isolation claim.
- The feature freeze is preserved: this is a test correction and runtime proof, not a new feature.

### Approved next bounded task

Prove one direct **real Fedora Desktop application ↔ real Companion application** development journey,
using the existing production Link surfaces rather than `companion_link_emulator_fixture.py`:

1. Use the current approved Fedora development source/application and unchanged approved Companion
   debug APK in isolated temporary workspaces. Do not rebuild or rerun broad suites merely for this
   checkpoint.
2. Launch exactly one clean API-35 emulator with no physical Android target present, then launch the
   real Fedora ROMVERSE Desktop application and open their existing ROMVERSE Link screens.
3. Generate the short-lived code in Desktop, enter the exact endpoint/fingerprint/code in Companion,
   compare the same derived safety code on both visible applications, and exercise every existing
   affirmative/decline decision required by the production flow. Do not bypass either UI or inject
   pairing state.
4. Demonstrate a genuine authenticated paired state and at least two fresh bounded health/mission
   snapshots delivered by the real Desktop transport, with the Companion Live Console remaining
   structured/privacy-filtered and `execution_authority: none`.
5. Restart/reopen the presentation only where the existing product supports it and demonstrate that
   remembered-session reconnection neither duplicates the session nor grants authority. Exercise the
   existing reset/revoke control and prove the old credential no longer reconnects.
6. Capture readable evidence from both applications and retain exact hashes/logs while redacting the
   short-lived pairing code. Shut down Desktop, Companion/emulator, listener, and ADB target at the end.

This is an integration/operability milestone, not authorization to implement or redesign Link. If the
unchanged products cannot complete the journey, preserve the smallest reproducible product blocker,
commit only the evidence/handoff, and stop for Product Assurance. Do not edit application source,
weaken pairing, add a fixture/test hook, install dependencies, connect a phone, merge platform
branches, enable Recovery, sign, publish, or release.

### Acceptance criteria

- Both actual development applications visibly complete the existing pairing journey without the
  fixture or private-state injection.
- Desktop and Companion display the same safety code and retain their meaningful approval boundaries.
- Two fresh authenticated snapshots, structured Live Console state, zero execution authority,
  remembered-session reconnection, and explicit revocation are demonstrated truthfully.
- No physical target, mutating ADB/Fastboot command, Recovery execution, relock, blind retry,
  production trust, or release action occurs.
- Update `docs/sync/BUILD-STATUS.md`, commit and push the bounded checkpoint, and stop for independent
  review. A genuine failure stops the run; do not loop or silently change source.

## Reviewed checkpoint: 1e0d4fe

- Handoff commit: `1e0d4fec65d9b2affc4174e8b40e5a6865187df3`
- Prior Product Assurance authorization:
  `1bc798bbca7a0f6a88dfa2514a25f130245c3d33`
- Title: `Record contained Link instrumentation failure`
- Branch: `linux/stage1-desktop-readiness`
- Review status: **CORRECTION REQUIRED — STALE TEST INTERACTION; APPLICATION SAFETY FLOW RETAINED**

### Decision

The environment correction worked exactly: clean-worktree ROMVERSE source and the existing verified
dependency environment were separated correctly, the exact emulator and APK admission passed, and
the committed fixture reached a genuine TLS-ready state with `execution_authority: none`.

The remaining failure is independently localized to an outdated instrumentation interaction. The
test still searches for and directly checks a checkbox whose text begins
`I confirmed the Link safety code`. The current application intentionally no longer exposes that
bypass. Its internal confirmation checkbox is disabled and the real user journey requires the
visible `CONFIRM DESKTOP IDENTITY` dialog and affirmative `YES • CODE MATCHES` action.

The application behavior is the safer and authoritative contract. Do not weaken or alter it. The
minimum correction is confined to the existing Link instrumentation test so it navigates through
and asserts the current meaningful safety confirmation before pairing.

### Independent evidence

- Commit `1e0d4fe` changes only `docs/sync/BUILD-STATUS.md`; the worktree is clean and matches the
  remote branch.
- The fixture log hash and runner log hash independently match the handoff:
  `07d6cbdb23d72d8b22e98841a9afcd579e81016ac742eb1d142dfc95b0d19632` and
  `ca19e7914c5ef971c1080697c6f62aa132e513e7e307370fc80d78f1c8fae7bd`.
- The raw runner records 11 success completions, one failure, zero assumption skips, and
  `FAILURES!!!` for 12 tests.
- The one failure is a `NoSuchElementException` inside
  `tlsPinnedLinkCarriesLiveConsoleAndReconnectsAfterRecreation`, before any pairing request.
- The committed test directly searches for the retired checkbox text and sets `isChecked = true`.
- The committed application instead renders `Safety code confirmation is waiting`, keeps the
  checkbox disabled/non-clickable, and exposes a dialog containing the derived safety code, an
  explicit no-device-command explanation, a decline action, and `YES • CODE MATCHES`.
- The three pairing inputs and the Link route remain present; no evidence supports an application
  navigation or TLS defect at this boundary.

### Fixture containment classification

The fixture uses the production local-network transport, which binds a short-lived TLS listener to
all local interfaces and emits the existing discovery broadcast. It is therefore contained by
ephemeral identity, short-lived code, explicit approval, bounded duration, and zero execution
authority—not by a private network namespace or loopback-only bind.

That behavior must be described honestly. It does not require a production transport change in
this correction: no external request was observed, no reusable token existed, the unapproved
fixture accepted no telemetry, and the process/listener closed immediately after failure. The next
run must retain the same brief bounded lifetime, never expose its code externally, and verify no
unexpected request appears before the explicit in-emulator confirmation.

### Required minimum correction

Modify only
`companion/app/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/radforge/romverse/companion/MainActivityInstrumentedTest.kt`
within the clean Linux worktree:

1. In the existing TLS-pinned Link test, explicitly open the existing Link destination before
   interacting with its fields.
2. Populate only the fixture endpoint, certificate fingerprint, and six-digit pairing code.
3. Remove the stale direct-checkbox mutation.
4. Activate the existing `CONNECT WIRELESSLY` action and require the real confirmation dialog.
5. Assert the displayed safety code exactly matches the code derived from the supplied certificate
   fingerprint and assert the dialog retains its read-only/no-command authority explanation.
6. Select `YES • CODE MATCHES` through the visible/accessibility UI surface. Do not use reflection,
   private-field access, test-only application hooks, preference mutation, or another bypass.
7. Confirm the fixture receives no pairing request before that explicit affirmative action.
8. Preserve all existing post-pairing assertions: TLS pin, two fresh health snapshots, encrypted
   remembered-session storage/reconnection, schema-six Live Console, Device DNA, Ascension,
   `Execution authority: NONE`, and permanent bootloader-relock prohibition.

Do not modify `MainActivity.kt`, navigation, production transport, fixture behavior, protocol,
dependencies, Gradle configuration, or any protected original-checkout file. This is a correctness
repair to stale test interaction only, not a feature change.

### Acceptance criteria

- The exact test-source diff is limited to the interaction/assertion changes above.
- The instrumentation APK is rebuilt from the unchanged approved application source; its new hash,
  package/target/runner identities, debug signer and certificate are recorded and independently
  verified. The application APK must remain byte-identical at its approved hash.
- Relevant compile/static gates pass without weakening or removing an assertion.
- One clean API-35 host-GPU runtime uses the same exact-target, SELinux-enforcing, verified Python
  environment, ephemeral fixture, and artifact admission boundaries.
- The complete 12-test suite passes 12/12 with zero failure and zero skip.
- The fixture emits `ready`, then no request before explicit visible confirmation, then `approved`,
  two fresh health snapshots, and `complete`, always with `execution_authority: none`.
- Bounded readable evidence shows the paired Link state and current confirmation path; Live Console,
  Device DNA, and Ascension evidence remain truthful.
- Fixture and emulator are shut down; ADB is empty; no unexpected client or listener remains.

Any failure ends the task without another source change or retry.

### Approved next bounded task

Implement only the minimum test correction above, rebuild only what is required for the debug
instrumentation artifact, and perform its one exact contained integration run. Update
`docs/sync/BUILD-STATUS.md`, commit and push the exact checkpoint on
`linux/stage1-desktop-readiness`, then stop for independent Product Assurance review.

No physical phone, application behavior change, production Recovery, production trust/signing,
platform merge, publication, or release is authorized.
